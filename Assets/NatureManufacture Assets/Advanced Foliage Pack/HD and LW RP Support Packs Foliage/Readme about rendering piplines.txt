Make note that packs work with this versions of render piplines which are suitable for unity 2018.3+ and 2019.1
-4.9 Lightweight rendering pipline (LW RP) for 2018.3+
-4.9 High Definition rendering pipline (HD RP) for 2018.3+
-5.7 Lightweight rendering pipline (LW RP) for 2019.1
-5.7 High Definition rendering pipline (HD RP) for 2019.1
To setup such version simply chose  proper lw or hd  version in package manager and install it.
We advice to setup fresh unity project and chose hd or lw pipline at start. 

It's very difficult to setup render pipline yourself in engine and upgrade standard project.

LW RP - It's basicly very stable and all our functions and shaders work there properly.
HD RP - very fluid and unstable.

Make note that hd rp doesnt have grass system at terrain yet at all so demo with terrain is not possible.
